    <h1>Hi</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<p>After graduating Berners-Lee found employment as an engineer for Plessey Telecom located in Poole, Dorset and he worked on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology. In 1978 he moved to D.G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset which was run by two of his friends Dennis Nash and John Poole, where he created type-setting software for printers and wrote and a multitasking operating system.

From June to December in 1980, he worked for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) as an independent software engineer. While he was there, he made a proposal for a project based on “hypertext” which would make sharing and updating of information by researchers easier and more convenient. Berners-Lee then devised a prototype system called ENQUIRE to demonstrate how it would work. The name came from a Victorian book called “Enquire Within Upon Everything.”</p>
